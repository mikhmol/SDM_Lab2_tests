# SDM_Lab2_tests
Software development methodology, lab 2

## Description
First program implements a list based on built-in arrays/listsusing the List class. The second program implements a one-way linked circular list using the List class. The class represents a list of characters and provides various methods to manipulate and retrieve data from the list. The program includes a main.js file where you can demonstrate the usage of all the methods in any desired order. The list.test.js file contains unit tests for each method to ensure their correctness and functionality.

## Conclusion

By running the unit tests, developers can gain confidence in the functionality of the List class and detect any potential bugs or issues early in the development cycle. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, invalid inputs, and expected behaviors, ensuring that the methods perform as intended and produce the desired results. It was interesting to work and they play a big role in validating the correctness.
